# Exercise: Use the notes/comments after the variable initialisation to create a nested if statement that will:

# 1. Check 'userAge' against the 'ageLimit

# 1.1 When the 'userAge' is not greater that the 'ageLimit then display a suitable message

# 2. When the 'userAge' is greater than the 'ageLimit' then execute another code block( that asks user to provide a code, see 2.1 below)

# 2.1 create a variable called 'userCode' to ask for user input and compare the value provided(userCode) with the value held in passCode

# 3. When the 'userCode' is not the same as 'passCode' display a suitable message

# 3.1 When the 'userCode' is the same as 'passCode' display a suitable message



userAge = int(input("Enter your age: "))

ageLimit = 16

passCode = "Bootcamp"

# compare if the value held in userAge is greater than the value held in ageLimit


# execute the code block below if the comparison returns true


# nested if will execute if the codition above is true (if userAge > ageLimit:)

 # This else will execute if nested if condition above is false (userCode is not equal to passCode:)

# This else will execute if the if condition above is false ( userAge is less than the ageLimit:)
