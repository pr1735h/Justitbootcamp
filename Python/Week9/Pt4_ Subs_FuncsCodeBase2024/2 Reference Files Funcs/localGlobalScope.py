"Variable Scope "

# The scope of a variable is the section of the program where the variable can be accessed and modified.
# A variable declared in the main part of the program can be accessed globally by all subroutines. 
# It cannot be modified unless you explicitly state that the program should modify the global variable. 

"Global scope and Local scope"
# Variables can either have global scope or local scope. 

"Global scope"
# Global scope refers to a variable that can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the program, even from inside subroutines. 


"Local scope"
# Local scope refers to variables that can only be accessed and modified within the code block that they were declared.  


"Handling Variable Scope"
# Not all programming languages handle scope in the same way Python has been designed to discourage the modification 
# of global variables, youâ€™ll find out why during this lesson.
# Variables are local unless otherwise declared. 


"To Do: Predict, then Run, and then Investigate"

"Global variable"
# This variable has a global scope
globalNum = 5

# The subroutine localSubRoutine () is accessing the globalNum variable and displaying it as output. 
def localSubRoutine():
    # Access the globalNum variable declared outside of this subroutine
    print(f"Printed globalNum variable {globalNum}from outside of local subroutine\n")
    localNum = 10  # local variable that is declared inside localSubroutine
    print(f"Printed localNum variable {localNum} from local subroutine\n")


localSubRoutine()  # call subroutine
print(f"Printed globalNum variable {globalNum}from global\n")

"The code below will attempt to access locaNum from loacalsubroutine"
# print(f"attempt to access locaNum from loacalsubroutine {localNum} \n")

"Can you explain the output from the terminal when you run the print statement above?"
