# for variableName in rangeObject(numberOfIteration)
# for loops that use the range() function
# range() is the sequence that you are going to iterate through
# range() is a built-in function just like input(). 


# range(stop) -> range object range(start, stop[, step]) -> range object
# When you call the range function, you can pass it up to three values: 
# The start number
# The end number
# The step
