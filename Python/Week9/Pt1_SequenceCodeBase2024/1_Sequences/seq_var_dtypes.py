# Sequence in programming is a set of instructions performed in order,
# with each executed in turn

"Predict, then Run, and Investigate and modify"

# To DO:
print(2 * 2)   # Predict then Run, and Investigate
print()   # Modify to use a different operator
print()   # Modify to use a different operator
print()  # Make : Use a different number and/or operator

# \n = newline

print("Refactored code\n")
"Predict, then Run, and Investigate"
#To DO: What is dfferent in the terminal when the code below ise executed?
print(2 * 3, "\n", 2 + 3, "\n", 2 / 3, "\n", 21 - 3)

# The python interpreter prints anything as it is, if placed between speech marks/ quotations
print("My name is Abdul\nWelcome to python programming")

print("\nThis is Python Bootcamp")

# format print output
print("The answer to 2 x 3 =", 2 * 3)

#To DO: Exercise: use the print statement to print
# Your name
# Your address
# Your interests
# format your print function to print your details above in three separate lines
# Perform either addition or calculation with two numbers
# Use text (format your output) in your addition"

"Share your solution as screenshot in nearpod collaboration board"

"Note: If stuck with formating print statement , refer to the printFuncsFormats.py file"

"To DO:Extension: Research"
#What is variable in python
#Modify your program to use variables instead of hard coded values 



"Objectives"
"" '' #Variables and Variable naming convention
"" '' #Use meaningful identifiers
"" '' #Determine the need for variables
"" '' #Distinguish between declaration, initialisation, and assignment of variables 
"" '' #Demonstrate appropriate use of naming conventions
"" '' #Output data (e.g. print (myVvar))


"Research"
# What is variable in python
#Answer: A variable ........ â€‹

"Characteristics or features of variables"
# A variable .........

"Object references 1"
var_num = "an_object"  #  var_num is now a name referencing the object "an_object"
