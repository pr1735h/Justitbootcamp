"Research"
# What is variable in python
#Answer: A variable ........ ​​is a container for storing data values

"Characteristics or features of variables"
# A variable .........does not need to be declared before use, the type also does not need to be declared.
# A Python variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character. It cannot start with a number.
# It can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ). Variable names are case-sensitive2.

"Object references 1"
var_num = "an_object"  #  var_num is now a name referencing the object "an_object"
num1 = 10  # static object/value
num2 = 20  # static object/value
num3 = 30  # static object/value

"Predict, then Run, and Investigate"
"What is the function the object's type when used in as shown below?"
print(type(num1))

"This is what happens when you create a variable in python?"
# 1. Creates and int/float/string object (variable)
# 2. Assign the object the value
# 3. use or print the object
answer1 = num1 + num2
print(answer1)
answer2 = num3 * num2
print(answer2)
answer3 = answer1 + answer2
print(answer3)

"Assign multiple values(objects) to multiple variables in a single line"
#To DO: Complete the code below to assign values to the respective variables
name, address, interest = "your name", "your fake address", "your interest"
print(name, address, interest)

"Chained assignment"
first_child = second_child = third_child = "your name"
print(
    "I am the first child",
    first_child,
    "\nI am the second child",
    second_child,
    "\nI am the third child",
    third_child,
)

"You have now seen the how to assign multiple values(objects) to multiple variables and chained assignment."
"In your own words, can you explain the difference between the two?"
#The differences 
"""
When assigning multiple values to multiple variables each variable can have it's own unique value.
In Chained assignments the same value is applied to each variable.
"""

"Object references 2"
# Rather than creating a new object when num4 = num1 code is executed,
# it creates a symbolic name/reference, and num4 now point to the object with a value of 10
# same as num1
num4 = num1  # multiple references to the same object
print(id(num1))  # id returns the identify of an object
print(id(num4))

"Will the identity of the two objects referenced below be the same ?"
num1 = 10
num4 = "10"
print(id(num1))
print(id(num4))

# num1 = "10"
# print(type(num1))
# num1 = 10.0
# print(type(num1))

"What is the equivalent of python type in JavaScript?"
#The equivalent of type in Javascript is typeof.

"Knowledge Check"
#To DO: Write one thing you remember from what we covered so far?
"Multiple variables can be created at once and they can have seperate values or chained values which would give them all one value"

"Read, Run and investigate the lines of code below"

# Variable naming convention
username = "user1"  # meaningful name

# use of camel notation when the variable is a combination of two words
userName = "user2"

 # use snake case/underscore when the variable is a combination of two words
user_name = "user3" 

user4 = "paul0045"  # meaningful name

userAge = 23  # meaningful name

firstname = "Anna"  # meaningful name and use of single quotes in value

"DON'T DO THIS"
AGE = 12  # Unless it is a constant!!
# £cash or $cash
User = "muser"  # dont start variable with upper case
# user name = # no spaces between two words in variable assignment
# 1user = "jam"# no number at start of variable name

# Avoid doing the following:
# £errr = "money"  don't use a symbol
# AGE = 12 variable name should not be in all upper cases
# Username = "toby345" # don't start variable names with upper case character
# 2username = "Coder112345" #dont start variable names with number
# user name = "test user" # no spaces between variable name/s


"Research:" 
"To DO: Is there a difference in using dollar or any other currency symbol to declare variable in JS vs python?"
#Python does not allow variables to include currency symbols unlike javascript.
#Currency symbols are used to format string templates in Python.

"Further reading on variables naming convention and independent learning, see link(s) below"
# https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names
# https://namingconvention.org/python/


# Python constant
AGE = 12  # AGE is constant do not re-assign with a different object
print("\nOriginal age is", AGE)

AGE = 15
print("\nAge is now", AGE)

"Research:" 
"To DO: Investigate how python use make use of constants to answer if there is any similarity with constant use in JavaScript?"
#Constant variables are used to declare and assign a value that doesn't change in both Python and Javascript.
#In Python constants are declared by creating a variable name in all caps.
