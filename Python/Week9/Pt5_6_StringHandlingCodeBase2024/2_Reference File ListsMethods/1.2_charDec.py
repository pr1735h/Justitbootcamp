"Objective:"
"" '' # Use chr() and ord() to perform ASCII conversion
# Perform ASCII conversion in pyhon
# chr(97): takes in a decimal number and returns its character equivalent
# ord("a"): takes in a character and returns its character decimal equivalent

"To Do: Task 1:  Predict, then Run, and then Investigate the use of ord() function in python"
aChar = input("Enter a character: ")
# ord("a"): takes in a character: Return the Unicode code point for a one-character string.
convertChar = ord(aChar)  # ord"(a/b/c/d")
print(convertChar)

"To Do: Task2: Modify the code above to ask for an integer value then use the chr() to return its character equivalent"
"solution"



"Objective:"
"" '' # Create a function that returns a list
"" ''   # ~ Use randomisation to append items to a list
"" ''   # ~ Use the in operator and range function to generate a range of number to be added to a list.

"""To Do: Task 3: Complete the code block below to print a list of converted numbers as letter
 The question marks indicates where the code is missing """
 
"Extension: Uncomment the code to complete th task"
